The goal of this blog is to publish interesting posts on computer science and finance, my two favorite domains. My current ambition is to create a system that performs data collection, trade signal generation and finally trade execution. I will document the building of this system in a series of posts. These posts will feature both computer science and quantitative finance in conjunction. However, I will also post pure computer science and pure finance posts.

I like reading academical papers so I will sprinkle links to these in all relevant places.

If you wish to contact me, please send me an email at `info@valuelabs.space`.
